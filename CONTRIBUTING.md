# How to Contribute?
First of all, don't forget the [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Then decide where you want to contribute:
- libcore
- art
- frameworks/base
- Somewhere else
## libcore
As MintOS uses mvaisakh's libcore (https://github.com/mvaisakh/libcore) you either have to contribute there or get in touch with me (nift4) to create an patch or fork.
## art
Modify the existing patch by patching the source, modifiying things and creating a new patch that replaces the old one or add a new one :)
## frameworks/base
See above.
## Somewhere else
Probably you will need to create a new patch, but I suggest discussing with me (nift4) in a issue.
